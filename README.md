# AquaTools-Python
This is the Python command-line implementation of the AquaTools suite of scientific tools. 
It includes PPT and PPM calculators, volume calculators for cylindrical and rectangular aquariums, and a very precise TAN to UIA converter that accounts for salinity, PH, temperature and total ammoniacal nitrogen content.
